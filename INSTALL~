Installation Instructions
*************************

to install and use this program you will need following dependencies:
 * glib2-devel 
 * json-glib-devel
 * gtk3-devel (>= 3.4)
 * Vala, valac (tested with Vala 0.18.1)
 * ffmpeg2theora with all of it's dependencies (tested with ffmpeg2theora 0.29) 
 * and more (like gcc, make, glibc, etc)

configure and compile it with the following from the projects root directory (as user):
  > ./configure
  > make

In case you only want to test the program without installation, see the tip below.

Installation as root:
  > make install
  > mkdir /usr/local/share/theodoratranscode
  > cp ./src/theodoratranscode.ui /usr/local/share/theodoratranscode
(it could be that on some Linux systems the required UI file path differs, then
 open theodoratranscode in terminal to see where the UI file is required)

optional if there should be a icon in your Dektop Environment for theodoratranscode:
  > cp ./src/theodoratranscode.desktop /usr/share/applications/
  
optional to clean the sources:
  > make distclean

to uninstall the programm:
  > make uninstall
  > rm /usr/local/share/theodoratranscode/theodoratranscode.ui
  > rm /usr/share/applications/theodoratranscode.desktop

Tip:
In case you only want to compile and make the program without actually
installing it: 
* in the file theodoratranscode.vala comment the line 47, so that it looks like: 
//const string UI_FILE = Config.PACKAGE_DATA_DIR + "/" + "theodoratranscode.ui";
* in this same file uncomment the line afterwards:
const string UI_FILE = "src/theodoratranscode.ui";
Then use the command:
* mv ./src/theodoratranscode ./theodoratranscode
Now it should be possible to use theodoratranscode.

The program was during the development successfully tested on Fedora 17 and Fedora 18. 
Under Debian Wheezy it might not work. Last time I tested it in Anjuta under a Debian Wheezy
based distro it did not work, because of the InfoBars.
