Installation Instructions
*************************

to install and use this program you will need following dependencies:
 * glib2-devel (under Debian libglib2.0-dev)
 * json-glib-devel (under Debian: libjson-glib-dev)
 * gtk3-devel (version >=3.4; under Debian libgtk-3-0-dev)
 * ffmpeg2theora with all of it's dependencies (tested with version 0.27, 0.29) 
 * and more (like gcc, make, glibc or libstdc++, etc)

configure and compile it with the following from the projects root directory (as user):
  > ./configure
  > make

In case you only want to test the program without installation, see the first tip below.

Installation as root:
  > make install
  > mkdir /usr/local/share/theodoratranscode
  > cp ./src/theodoratranscode.ui /usr/local/share/theodoratranscode
(it could be that on some Linux systems the required UI file path differs, then
 open theodoratranscode in terminal to see where the UI file is required)

optional if there should be a icon in your Dektop Environment for theodoratranscode:
  > cp ./src/theodoratranscode.desktop /usr/share/applications/
  
optional to clean the sources:
  > make distclean

to uninstall the programm:
  > make uninstall
  > rm /usr/local/share/theodoratranscode/theodoratranscode.ui
  > rm /usr/share/applications/theodoratranscode.desktop

Tips:
1)	In case you only want to compile and make the program without actually
	installing it: 
	* in the file theodoratranscode.vala comment the line 49, so that it looks like: 
	//const string UI_FILE = Config.PACKAGE_DATA_DIR + "/" + "theodoratranscode.ui";
	* in this same file uncomment the line afterwards:
	const string UI_FILE = "src/theodoratranscode.ui";
	Then use the command:
	* mv ./src/theodoratranscode ./theodoratranscode
	Now it should be possible to use theodoratranscode.

2)	the UI with the InfoBars does not work on Debian 7 based and some other systems.
	If you are on a Debian 7 based system or in case you do not like the UI with 
	the infobars, use the file theodoratranscode_debian.ui
	* in theodoratranscode.vala comment the line 49 
	* either uncomment the line 53, in case you want to install it as root and then
	make sure that the file theodoratranscode_debian.ui is at the correct location
	* or uncomment line 54, to just use the binary file from the theodoratranscode
	folder (see tip 1)

The program was tested with success on Fedora 17, Fedora 18, Fedora 19 alpha, 
and a Debian Wheezy (soon Debian 7) based system.
